									<li><span class="fa-li"></span><p>Welcome to the Integrating Parallel and Distributed Computing in Introductory Programming Classes (IPDC) homepage</p>
									</li>
									
									<li><span class="fa-li"></span><p>PDC emphasizes both performance and sharing. Introducing the concepts and practices that
									improve performance through parallelism and that enable the sharing of information and resources through distributed computing
									provides students with necessary skills. However, most undergraduate computer science (CS) programs do not teach parallel
									computing concepts, and CS undergraduates are typically exclusively trained to think and program sequentially. The gap is a
									widening rapidly between the emerging highly parallel computer architectures and the sequential programming approach taught
									in traditional CS undergraduate curriculums. Undergraduate programs should train the CS students to think parallel and code
									parallel from the beginning of the curriculum. IEEE/ACM joint taskforce on Computing Curricula has recommended integration
									of PDC topics in undergraduate curriculum as vital to comprehensive CS education.</p>
									</li>
									
									<li><span class="fa-li"></span><p>Primarily, there are two models of PDC education in undergraduate program: single PDC course
									and threading PDC topics into traditional CS courses. The single course approach is typically offered as an elective upper division class
									in undergraduate curriculum. Most institutions do not offer such dedicated course because faculty expertise in this area is not always available
									and adding extra PDC course to a full curriculum is challenging. While few colleges and universities have added PDC course, the computing academic
									community has been slow to integrate PDC as part of the entire curriculum. The challenges for integrating PDC into CS curriculum are significant
									for most institutions because : a) lack of faculty to teach PDC, b) lack of teaching resources, c) room to spare in CS curriculum. Typically,
									adding new content to a course may require removing existing content due to the density of topics covered in a typical CS course. However,
									many opportunities exist that apply “thinking in parallel” to traditional topics. The objective of our effort is to create a collaborative
									repository of readily available PDC modules that can be easily integrated in existing CS courses without much effort required by the instructors.</p>
